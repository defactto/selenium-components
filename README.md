# Selenium-components: a collection of page objects for common components

## Compatibility
Because of heavy type hinting usage, Python3.5 and above is supported. 

## TODO
+ add docs
+ add tests
+ CI integration
+ add support for [react components](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components)
+ potential support for Python versions under 3.5
